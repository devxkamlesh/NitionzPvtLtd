   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Firebase Setup**
   - The Firebase configuration is already set up using the credentials from Design Flow.md
   - Make sure your Firebase project has the following collections:
     - `users` - for user data and KYC information
     - `contact_submissions` - for contact form submissions
     - `orders` - for investment orders (future implementation)

4. **Environment Variables**
   - Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`
   - The Firebase config is already included

5. **Run development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Open in browser**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Firebase Collections Setup

The application expects these Firestore collections:

#### `contact_submissions`
```javascript
{
  name: string,
  email: string,
  phone: string,
  subject: string,
  message: string,
  timestamp: serverTimestamp(),
  status: 'new' | 'read' | 'replied',
  submittedAt: string,
  source: string,
  userAgent: string,
  url: string
}
```

#### `users`
```javascript
{
  name: string,
  email: string,
  phone: string,
  createdAt: Date,

    docs: [],
    submittedAt: Date | null,
    reviewedAt: Date | null,
    reviewedBy: string | null,
    comment: string
  },

## Key Features Implementation

### Authentication Flow

#### Email/Password Authentication
1. User registers with email/password
2. Firebase creates user account
3. User document created in Firestore with KYC status
4. Protected routes check authentication status

#### Google Authentication
1. User clicks "Continue with Google"
2. Google OAuth popup for account selection
3. Automatic user document creation in Firestore
4. Redirect to dashboard with profile completion prompts

### Investment Process
1. User completes KYC verification
2. Admin approves KYC (enables BUY buttons)
3. User selects investment plan
4. Bank transfer instructions provided
5. User uploads payment proof
6. Admin verifies payment
7. Order status updated to "paid"

### Admin Workflow
- KYC document review and approval
- Payment proof verification
- Order status management
- User management and reporting

## Usage

### Testing the Application

1. **Homepage**: Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the landing page with hero slideshow
2. **Contact Form**: Go to `/contact` and submit a form to test Firebase integration
3. **Admin Panel**: Visit `/admin` to view contact submissions (requires authentication)
4. **Authentication**: Test user registration and login at `/auth/register` and `/auth/login`
5. **Investment Plans**: View available plans at `/investment-plans`
6. **Dashboard**: User dashboard at `/dashboard` (requires authentication)

### Key Features to Test

- ✅ Contact form submission and storage in Firestore
- ✅ User registration and authentication (Email/Password + Google)
- ✅ **Google Sign-In functionality**
- ✅ Admin panel for viewing contact submissions
- ✅ Responsive design on mobile and desktop
- ✅ SEO optimization with meta tags
- ✅ KYC status tracking in dashboard
- ✅ Profile completion for Google users

### Admin Panel Access

Currently, any authenticated user can access the admin panel at `/admin`. In production, you should implement proper role-based access control.

### Contact Form Data

All contact form submissions are stored in the `contact_submissions` collection and can be viewed in the admin panel with:
- Contact information (name, email, phone)
- Subject and message
- Submission timestamp
- Status tracking (new, read, replied)
- Admin actions to mark as read/replied

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Firebase Connection Error**: Make sure your Firebase project is active and the configuration is correct
2. **Build Errors**: Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
3. **Port Already in Use**: Next.js will automatically try the next available port (3001, 3002, etc.)

### Firebase Security Rules

Make sure your Firestore has appropriate security rules. For development, you can use:

```javascript
// Firestore Security Rules
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow authenticated users to read/write their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Allow anyone to write contact submissions
    match /contact_submissions/{document} {
      allow create: if true;
      allow read, update: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```
